- A **hub** is a basic networking device that simply forwards data to all devices in a network.
- It does **not** filter or manage traffic, which means it sends the same data to all connected devices, even if only one needs it.
- This can lead to **network congestion** and inefficiency.
- Hubs operate at **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)** of the OSI model.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** An old-school network where all computers receive the same data, even if it's not meant for them.

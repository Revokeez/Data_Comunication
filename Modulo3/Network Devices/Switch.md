- A **switch** is more intelligent than a hub. It directs data only to the specific device that needs it, improving efficiency.
- Switches use **MAC addresses** to forward data only to the intended recipient.
- They operate at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model (some advanced switches also operate at Layer 3).
- Switches improve **network performance and security** compared to hubs.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** In an office network, a switch connects multiple computers but ensures data is sent only to the intended recipient.
